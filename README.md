# Mike & Mikes Playstaion Repair
This is a newly designed Modern website for a local console repair shop. The site was created based on the owner's love for consoles and gaming as well as their love for superheroes. The site was created using the following technologies HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Bootstrap, React, and Google Cloud Platform. This project showcases my ability to Design, Develop, and Deploy web applications.
